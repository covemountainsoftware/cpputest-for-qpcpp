The software supporting this CppUTest port of the 
QP/C++ Real-Time Embedded Framework is licensed under a 
dual-licensing model. Most of the files present in this
repository are only needed for host PC based test execution.
However, a few of the examples and files may find their way
into a product's build. But guess what? Even the commercial
license is free! Simply register the product line using
this software, and I will provide a free commercial
friendly license.
